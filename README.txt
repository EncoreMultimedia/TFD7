The drupal 7 implementation of the Twig template language.

For more information about Twig, visit http://twig-project.org

To use the library, please download the lib folder from http://github.com/renebakx/twig-for-drupal and place that folder on the same level as the twig.engine file.

Structure will look this this :

/engines/twig/twig.engine
/engines/twig/lib/...

Please do note, this version is far from stable. Only use if you feel lucky, or want to chip in some code to get this show on the road ;)
